This is developed as a spring boot application to make adding shipments, destinations and shippers information easy through
swagger ui or postman

Swagger UI can be accessed from http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html

Following are the steps to initialize
- add initial shipment
- add destinations and shippers
- above 2 steps can be performed in any order
- then after all shipments, destinations and shippers are added call initialize method

Explanation of project and assumptions:

- A shipment can be added once and from then periodically based on configured property, this shipment is used to produce mails.
- The initialize method is called only once. No exception handling mechanism is in place to avoid multiple calls to initialize
- Please check application.properties file to provide the default properties.
- It is assumed that each shipment is in a new ship. So each shipment runs in a separate thread.
- It is assumed that There is only one email notification engine which consumes messaged emitted by shipments and sends mail to shippers
